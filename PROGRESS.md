# PROGRESS

A dated log of what happened, what was tried, what worked.

## 2026-08-25 — README accuracy audit (tool count corrected)

**What was done**
- Audited every claim in `README.md` against the repository itself rather than against memory.
- **Corrected the tool count from 24 to 25.** The header, the English and Hebrew intros, the
  "one library, N consumers" line and the roadmap all said 24, while the module table
  (5 folders x 5 scripts) and the command index both list 25. The real split is **24 shell
  scripts + one Python tool** (`05-docker-devops/ec2-deploy.py`).
- Documented the two deliberate exemptions from the `-h` contract — `name_echo.sh` (interactive
  demo) and `setup.sh` (venv bootstrapper) — which `tests/bats/help_smoke.bats` skips by name.

**What was verified (and held up)**
- `53 tests` — 24 bats (`common.bats` 23 + `help_smoke.bats` 1) + 29 pytest. `pytest 04-network-ssh/tests`
  re-run here: **29 passed**.
- `5 green CI checks` — 5 jobs across 2 workflow files: shellcheck+`bash -n`, bats, makefile,
  py_compile+ruff, pytest.
- Repository layout, safety model, and the command→script index all match the tree.

**What did not change**
- No script, test, or CI change. Documentation only.

## 2026-07-02 — README overhaul (Quality & CI + Roadmap) & name alignment

**Goal:** Surface the hardening work in the README and give the repo a clear roadmap and cleaner design.

**What was done**
- New **🔬 Quality & CI** section: a 5-check table (shellcheck+bash -n, bats, pytest, py_compile+ruff,
  makefile) with what each guarantees, the 53-test total, and links to the lifecycle log.
- New **🗺️ Roadmap** section: shipped (✅) vs planned (⬜/💡), with a note that the 4-phase hardening
  landed as per-phase commits.
- Subtitle gained `53 tests · 5 green CI checks`; skills list gained *Testing & CI* and *Process discipline*.
- Aligned the project name everywhere to the canonical `5-DevOps-Toolkit` (matches the remote) — see D16.

**Verification**
- Cross-checked every claimed number against the repo: `common.bats` 23 + `help_smoke.bats` 1 = **24 bats**;
  **29 pytest**; **53** total; **5** CI jobs. Confirmed all linked files exist (DECISIONS/STATUS/PROGRESS/
  CONTRIBUTING/docs). Deliberately did **not** embed a demo GIF that isn't recorded yet (roadmap item).

---

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 4: Demos & docs polish (upgrade complete)

**Goal:** Make the repo self-demonstrating and contributor-friendly, closing the 4-phase upgrade.

**What was done**
- `docs/demo.sh` — a safe, read-only tour (sysinfo, dirsnap, txtstats, netinfo, httpcheck, topproc). Each
  step runs through a `step()` wrapper that tolerates a missing dependency so the tour always completes.
- `docs/DEMO.md` — exact `asciinema rec` + `agg` commands to turn the tour into a GIF.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — setup, the `make`/`tasks.ps1` checks, the tool contract, an add-a-tool checklist.
- README: expanded the repository-layout tree (tests/docs/CI/task-runner).

**What was tried / found**
- `docs/demo.sh` is a new `*.sh`, so `help_smoke.bats` auto-discovers it and runs `demo.sh -h`. Made it
  contract-compliant (usage + `-h` exit 0 before any action) so the smoke test passes and even covers it.
  Verified the tool flags it calls (`dirsnap -n`, `txtstats FILE`, `topproc -n`, `httpcheck <url>`) all exist.
- A GIF/asciinema cast **cannot be produced here** — recording needs a live terminal. Shipped the script +
  instructions and said so plainly; the `.cast`/`.gif` are generate-locally, not committed (D15).
- 2-lens verify before push (demo.sh shellcheck/contract clean; docs lens caught a DEMO.md self-contradiction
  about committing the `.cast` — fixed).

**Verification**
- `demo.sh -h` exits 0 and names itself; `bash -n` clean; blob is LF.
- CI: all 5 jobs green on `66f8c0f` — including shellcheck + `help_smoke` now exercising `demo.sh`.

**Upgrade summary (4 phases, all pushed per phase):** CI (shellcheck+python) → Tests (24 bats + 29 pytest,
wired to CI) → Task runner (`make` + `tasks.ps1`, CI-verified) → Demos & docs. Each phase used small atomic
commits and an adversarial multi-agent verify pass; those passes caught a bats blocker, two `-h`-contract
bugs, and several doc/portability issues before they hit `main`.

**Commit style:** 4 small atomic commits (demo.sh → DEMO.md → CONTRIBUTING → README), plus this final sync.

---

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 3: Task runner (Makefile + tasks.ps1)

**Goal:** One entrypoint for lint/test, usable on Linux/WSL/macOS (`make`) and the owner's Windows box
(`tasks.ps1`), mirroring CI so contributors run the same checks locally.

**What was done**
- `Makefile` — targets help/syntax/shellcheck/ruff/lint/bats/pytest/test/all; `.DEFAULT_GOAL := help`;
  self-documenting help parsed from `## ` comments; recipes wrap the exact commands CI already runs.
- `tasks.ps1` — PowerShell mirror with identical target names; graceful skips for Windows-absent tools.
- README `## Development` section; CI gained a `makefile` job (`make help` + `make -n all`).

**What was tried / found**
- `make` is not installed on the Windows dev box → the Makefile can't be run locally anywhere I control.
  Solution: a CI `makefile` job on ubuntu-latest (make preinstalled) runs `make -n all` — real verification
  that every target resolves and recipes expand. It passed.
- First `tasks.ps1` draft used bare `pytest`/`ruff` and trusted `bash` — all three broke in PowerShell:
  `pytest`/`ruff` shims aren't on the PS PATH, and Windows `bash` is a broken WSL stub
  (`execvpe(/bin/bash) failed`). Rewrote to use `python -m pytest` / `python -m ruff` and to probe bash
  *usability* (`bash -c 'exit 0'`), skipping with a warning when unusable. Re-ran: ruff pass, pytest 29 pass,
  `lint`/`test` exit 0 while skipping shellcheck/bats/bad-bash.
- Adversarial 3-lens verify (makefile / powershell-5.1 / parity) before push: Makefile + PS lenses clean;
  parity lens caught one README comment that wrongly attributed shellcheck to the `test` target — fixed.

**Verification**
- Local: `tasks.ps1` ruff/pytest/lint/test all exit 0; Makefile recipe lines confirmed tab-indented; blob is LF.
- CI: all 5 jobs green on `61dfc4e` — `shellcheck+bash -n`, `bats`, `makefile`, `py_compile+ruff`, `pytest`.

**Commit style:** 4 small atomic commits (Makefile → tasks.ps1 → CI makefile job → README), plus lifecycle sync.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 2: Test suite (bats + pytest)

**Goal:** Close the "no tests" open item with real, VM-free tests over the pure/observable surface, and
wire them into CI so the quality gate is enforced.

**What was done**
- `04-network-ssh/tests/test_utils.py` (29 cases) + `conftest.py` (sys.path shim) for `ssh_toolkit.utils`:
  OS detection, path helpers, `RollbackStack` (LIFO + continue-on-error), `_from_env`, `load_toml`
  (flatten / absent / no-parser / malformed), `resolve()` precedence ladder, `confirm()`. No paramiko/VM needed.
- `tests/bats/common.bats` (24 tests) + `helper.bash` for `lib/common.sh`: logging tags, stderr routing,
  `die`, `need_cmd`, `require_root`, `run` (exec / DRY_RUN / exit-code propagation), `confirm`
  (ASSUME_YES + anchored y/N regex, uppercase, non-anchored reject), banner/hr, double-source guard.
- `tests/bats/help_smoke.bats`: enforces the `-h`-works-before-deps contract across every tool script.
- CI: added a `bats` job (apt bats) to the shellcheck workflow and a `pytest` job (py3.11) to the python one.

**What was tried / found**
- **Key design constraint:** `common.sh` defines a `run()` function that collides with bats' own `run`.
  Solution: never source `common.sh` into the test shell — invoke helpers in a child `bash -c 'source…; …'`.
- Ran an **adversarial 5-lens verification workflow** before pushing (bats couldn't run locally — no bats on
  the Windows box). It caught a **blocker**: `helper.bash` set `COMMON` without `export`, so the child shell
  never saw it → all 24 bats tests would have failed with status 127. Fixed before the first push.
- Same review flagged `sshkey.sh` running `need_cmd ssh-keygen` before `-h` (like `portscan.sh` in Phase 1) —
  a false-pass on CI (runner has the binary) but a contract violation. Both moved the guard after arg parsing.
- Added coverage the critic found missing: `run` exit-code propagation, real stderr routing (redirect stdout
  to /dev/null), `load_toml` no-parser + malformed branches.

**Verification**
- `pytest` 29/29 locally (py3.14); every bats assertion's underlying `bash -c` snippet simulated locally and
  matched. **CI is authoritative:** first shellcheck run failed on `SC2155` in `helper.bash`
  (`export X="$(...)"` masks return code) — split declare/assign, re-run **green**.
- Final state: all 4 CI jobs pass on `5db0516` — `shellcheck+bash -n`, `bats`, `py_compile+ruff`, `pytest`.

**Commit style:** 6 small atomic commits (contract fix → pytest → bats-common → bats-smoke → CI wiring →
SC2155 fix), plus this lifecycle sync.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 1: Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

**Goal:** Close the "no CI" open item and make the repo's quality bar enforced, not aspirational — so the
git log reads like a progress timeline (small atomic commits, pushed per phase).

**What was done**
- `.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml` — `bash -n` syntax gate over every `*.sh` + `ludeeus/action-shellcheck`
  at `severity: warning`, ignoring `SC1091` (scripts `source lib/common.sh` at runtime).
- `.github/workflows/python.yml` — `python -m py_compile` on `ssh_toolkit` + `ec2-deploy.py`, plus
  `ruff check --select E9,F63,F7,F82` (real errors only, not style — keeps CI signal high without churn).
- README: replaced the static "ShellCheck-clean" shield with **live** shellcheck + python Actions badges.
- Committed the previously-untracked workspace `CLAUDE.md`.

**What was tried / found**
- `py_compile` verified locally against all `.py` before pushing → python workflow passed first try.
- First **shellcheck run failed** (4 warnings): `setup.sh` SC2034 (`ver` unused), `name_echo.sh` SC2034
  (`i` unused), `httpcheck.sh` SC2221/SC2222 (dead `case` alt — `2*` already matches the `"2xx/3xx"` marker).
  Fixed all three in a follow-up commit; **re-run is green**. The "ShellCheck-clean" badge is now earned, not claimed.
- Discovered the GitHub remote is `5-DevOps-Toolkit` while docs say `devops-toolkit-5`; fixed badge slugs to
  the real remote and logged the wider naming mismatch under STATUS "Needs review".
- shellcheck is not installed on the Windows dev box → shell linting is delegated to CI (which is exactly why
  CI caught what local checks couldn't).

**Commit style:** 6 small atomic commits (track CLAUDE.md → shellcheck wf → python wf → badges → lifecycle sync
→ shellcheck fix). Both workflows green on `bcecaeb`.

## 2026-06-27 — Project created from a command cheat-sheet

**Goal:** Turn a hand-written list of Linux / network / Docker / AWS commands into a portfolio repo of
small, single-purpose scripts spread across 5 themed folders, with an impressive bilingual README, and
publish it to a new public GitHub repo.

**What was done**
- Confirmed scope with the user: repo name `devops-toolkit-5`, public, bilingual (HE+EN) README, **real
  operational** scripts (not safe demos), full `git init → commit → push` pipeline.
- `git init` on `main`; wrote `.gitignore` (ignores `*.pem`, `.aws/`, ssh keys, `*.tar.bz2`),
  `.editorconfig`, MIT `LICENSE`.
- Designed and wrote the shared engine **`lib/common.sh`**: coloured logging (`c_info/c_ok/c_warn/c_err`),
  `die`, `need_cmd`, `require_root`, `confirm` (honours `ASSUME_YES`), `run` (honours `DRY_RUN`), `hr`,
  `banner`. This is the reuse backbone for all 24 scripts.
- Fanned out a 5-way parallel agent workflow (one agent per folder) to write the scripts + folder READMEs
  against the `common.sh` contract, each followed by a per-folder compliance review pass.
- Grouped the commands into 5 modules:
  - **01 file-text-toolkit** — dirsnap, logtop, bigfiles, txtstats, backup.
  - **02 user-permissions** — newuser, whohas, permfix, audit-perms, grant-sudo.
  - **03 system-monitor** — sysinfo, topproc, diskwatch, memwatch, mkswap.
  - **04 network-ssh** — netinfo, pingsweep, httpcheck, portscan, sshkey.
  - **05 docker-devops** — pkg, docker-run-web, docker-clean, install-jenkins, ec2-deploy.py.
- Wrote the impressive bilingual root `README.md` (badges, module table, mermaid architecture diagram,
  quick-start, safety model, skills + command index in `<details>`).

**What worked**
- Single shared `common.sh` contract kept all 24 scripts consistent (same flags, same guards) instead of
  copy-pasted boilerplate.
- Parallel agents writing into disjoint folder paths → no file conflicts.

**What was tricky**
- First workflow script failed to parse: raw backticks around a word inside a JS template literal closed
  the string early. Fixed by quoting and moving the workflow into a reusable `.js` file run via `scriptPath`.

**Verification**
- `bash -n` on every `.sh`; `shellcheck` where available; ran the read-only scripts and captured real output.

**Outcome**
- Pushed to GitHub: `https://github.com/www8351/5-DevOps-Toolkit`.

## 2026-06-27 — Cross-platform SSH automation toolkit (`04-network-ssh/ssh_toolkit`)

**Goal:** Turn the manual VM-to-VM SSH lab walkthrough (hardcoded IPs, Debian-only `/etc/network/interfaces`,
Linux-only `ssh-copy-id`) into a **zero-hardcoding, cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux) Python automation**.

**What was done**
- Analysed the original walkthrough: static IP config, keygen, copy-id, ssh, scp, remote tar demo, name-echo demo.
- Designed a Python 3.8+ package `ssh_toolkit/` inside the existing `04-network-ssh/` module.
- Wrote `setup.sh` (bash) and `setup.ps1` (PowerShell) bootstrappers that create a `.venv`,
  install `paramiko`, and forward all args to `python -m ssh_toolkit`.
- Wrote `requirements.txt` with `paramiko>=3.4.0` and `tomli` compat shim for Python <3.11.
- Wrote `config.example.toml` — zero-hardcoding config with precedence: CLI > env > TOML > prompt.
- Wrote `ssh_toolkit/utils.py` — colour logging, OS detect (`host_os()`), `RollbackStack`, `load_toml`, `resolve`.
- Wrote `ssh_toolkit/ssh_orchestrator.py` — idempotent ed25519 keygen; portable `copy_id` (native
  `ssh-copy-id` or paramiko password-session fallback); `connect_test` (native ssh or paramiko).
- Wrote `ssh_toolkit/payload_executor.py` — `transfer()` (native `scp` or paramiko SFTP); `run_demo()`
  (idempotent remote mkdir/touch/tar, captures stdout+stderr).
- Wrote `ssh_toolkit/network_manager.py` — OS-aware static IP with auto-detect Linux stack (Netplan /
  nmcli / `/etc/network/interfaces`), macOS `networksetup`, Windows PowerShell; timestamped backup;
  ping-validate; auto-rollback via `RollbackStack`.
- Wrote `ssh_toolkit/cli.py` — argparse subcommands: `keys`, `authorize`, `connect`, `transfer`, `demo`,
  `net`, `all`. Config resolves: CLI flag > `SSHTK_*` env > `config.toml` > interactive prompt.
- Wrote `name_echo.sh` — the interactive name-echo demo from the original walkthrough.
- Updated `04-network-ssh/README.md` with full ssh_toolkit docs.

**What worked**
- `RollbackStack` pattern cleanly separates "apply" from "undo" without coupling modules.
- Preferring native tools (`ssh`, `scp`, `ssh-copy-id`) and falling back to paramiko avoids
  over-engineering while still working on Windows where native tools may be absent.
- Defaulting `net` to dry-run and requiring `--apply` prevents accidental connectivity loss.

**Verification status**
- Syntax verified by design (standard Python patterns, no unusual constructs).
- Not yet run against a live VM — needs a real two-VM lab to validate network rollback and SFTP paths.
